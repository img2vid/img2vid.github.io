This set of tools contain three tools that help in mass processing Project Gutenberg ebooks in .txt format to audiobooks. 

First, PGFormatter to clean Project Gutenberg ebooks so that they are ready to be converted to audio. 

Second, BalconGUI (Balcon Graphical User Interface), a software that accepts multiple .txt files cleaned by PGFormatter and converts them into .wav audio files. 

Third, img2vid, a software that converts the output of BalconGUI along with a cover image in .jpg format into a .mp3 audiobook. The duration for the audiobook should have the value of the duration of the .wav audio file.
